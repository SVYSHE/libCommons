# javautils

This repository shall create a solution for my daily java programming tasks.

## Overview

### DateTime

Can handle dates and times. Combines `java.util.Date` and `java.time.LocalDateTime` functionality and extracts only the needed methods.

## Future plans

- [ ] Handling databases
    - [ ] Establish [connection](https://www.javatpoint.com/steps-to-connect-to-the-database-in-java) via settings.json file
    - [ ] Statements based on class model (CRUD)
- [ ] Currency Class
    - [ ] Euro, USD, etc. with different notations (â‚¬,$, etc...)
- [ ] A port of the C++ `Badge<T>` concept to java, to prevent internal API's from being misused
- [ ] libCSV (RFC 4180 compliant)
- [ ] SQL Query builder for major SQL dialects based of of [danfickle/java-sql-query-builder](https://github.com/danfickle/java-sql-query-builder)

## Some possible but not yet planned features

- [ ] A [HOCON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOCON) base configuration class
